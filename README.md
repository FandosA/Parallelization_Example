# Simple Parallelization Exercises
The cpp files consist of simple exercise implemented in C++ to parallelize tasks, this way it is possible to perform these tasks faster using a determined number of threads from our proccessor.

The file ``find_prime_nums.cpp`` is an algorithm that finds the prime numbers, larger than a given value, in a given vector.
