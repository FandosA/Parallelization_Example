# Simple Parallelization Exercises
The cpp files consist of simple exercise implemented in C++ to parallelize tasks, this way it is possible to perform these tasks faster using a determined number of threads from our proccessor.

The file ``find_prime_nums.cpp`` is an algorithm that finds the prime numbers, larger than a given value, in an array. Setting the parameters, an array is randomly initialized with integer values within a range. Then, each thread looks for the prime numbers larger than the given value in its corresponding set of numbers, and finally they're printed.
